Bachelor of Computer Science - Semester 5th - College Project

Description: Developed an advanced Shop Management System desktop application using Java (for my college's semester 5th project) which decreases a shop ownerâ€™s time in generating bills (by way of auto-calculation of costs with GST), maintaining a list of all the products, suppliers and customers, and reduces paper work.
It can also print the bills which was implemented with the help of Print API.
